how to genrate .gitignore file in a simple method

Many popular code editors, like VSCode and JetBrains IDEs (PyCharm, IntelliJ, etc.), have built-in functionality or extensions that can generate a .gitignore file for you based on your project type.

In VSCode, for instance, you can search the Extensions Marketplace for "gitignore" and install one like the .gitignore Generator by Piotr Palarz. Once installed, you can use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) to search for and run the command to add a .gitignore file.
